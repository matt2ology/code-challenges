    """my attempt at solving the problem of checking if two strings are
    isomorphic during a coding interview. I was given the problem and had to
    solve it in 30 minutes.

    The code prompt: Given two strings check if they can be encoded
    (i.e are isomorphic) to each other.

    For example, "cat" and "dog" can be encoded to each other because
    the characters in "cat" can be replaced with the characters in "dog". "c"
    can be replaced with "d", "a" can be replaced with "o", and "t" can be
    replaced with "g". If the strings cannot be encoded to each other, return
    False.

    Args:
        s1 (str): First string to check if it can be encoded to s2
        s2 (str): Second string to check if it can be encoded to s1

    Returns:
        bool: True if the strings can be encoded to each other, False otherwise
